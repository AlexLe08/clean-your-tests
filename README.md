# Clean Your Tests

## Instructions

### Clean Your Tests
In the initial commit to this project, you have been provided with files that contain a JavaScript module and some associated tests. Currently all of the functions work and the tests all pass, however, there are no unit tests for most of the functions. You are to add tests for all of the currently untested functions.

### Deep Cover
In a new branch, continuing from Part 1 (Clean Your Tests), you are tasked with refactoring the tests for `calculateProductPrice`. Currently these tests are asserting return values but not that they are being calculated by the correct functions in the correct order. You should refactor these tests to conform to testing best practices.

### A Quick Commute
In a new branch, continuing from Part 2 (Deep Cover), you are tasked with using Test Driven Development to add the functionality required to calculate commuter products. Selected options for commuter products are of the form

```JSON
{ "electedCoverage": ["parking", "train"] }
```

where the array contains which coverage is being elected. This array can have both types, a single type, or even be empty (no coverage elected).

### A Trip to NYC
In a new branch, continuing from Part 3 (A Quick Commute), you are tasked with adding code coverage with NYC. Once you have your code coverage numbers, explore the code to explain why you got the result you got.
